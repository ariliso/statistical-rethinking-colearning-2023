## Workflow

1. Define generative model of the sample
1. Define a specific estimand
1. Design a statistical way to produce estimand
1. Test the statistical method using the generative model
1. Analyse the sample, summarize


## Globe tossing model

Estimand: proportion of globe covered in water

Given N samples, how should we use the sample? Produce a summary of the sample? Represent uncertainty?


First, think about how sample is produced and how variables influence on another. 


- P = proportion of water
- W = land observations
- W = water observations
- N = number of tosses

::: {.callout-note}
Variables can be things you observed or things you want to estimate
:::


```{r 01_dag, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggdag))
ggdag(dagify(
  L ~ P + N,
  W ~ P + N
), seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```
