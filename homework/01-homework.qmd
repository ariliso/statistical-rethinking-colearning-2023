## Question 1
> Suppose the globe tossing data (Lecture 2, Chapter 2) had turned out to be 4
water and 11 land. Construct the posterior distribution.



## Question 2
> Using the posterior distribution from 1, compute the posterior predictive
distribution for the next 5 tosses of the same globe. I recommend you use the
sampling method.


## Question 3
> Use the posterior predictive distribution from 2 to calculate the probability
of 3 or more water samples in the next 5 tosses.



## Question 4 (optional)
> This problem is an optional challenge for people who are taking the course for
a second or third time. Suppose you observe W = 5 water points, but you forgot
to write down how many times the globe was tossed, so you donâ€™t know the number
of land points L. Assume that p = 0.7 and compute the posterior distribution of
the number of tosses N. Hint: Use the binomial distribution.
