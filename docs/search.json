    "text": "Statistical models process data but to provide insight, we require scientific models. Causes of data cannot be extracted alone using a statistical model, we need causal models.\nCausal inference is the prediction of intervention and imputation of missing observations.\nCausal prediction: knowing a cause means being able to predict the consequences of an intervention. Causal imputation: knowing a cause means being able to construct unobserved counterfactual outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX is a treatment\nY is an outcome\nB is a competing cause of Y\nA is an influence of the treatment X\nC is a common cause of X and Y (a confound)\n\nRelationships between all variables can impact outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt one moment in time, DAGs are unidirectional. With a time series, you can have reciprocal relationships.\n\n\nDAGs are not specific to one model and therefore can be used for different queries and related models. These different models should not necessarily include all variables, and DAGs help us determine good and bad controls for each question. DAGs are logically specific and can be used to test and refine the causal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow do we justify controls in eg. the relationship between X and Y?\n\nWe need a DAG\nthen we analyse it to determine the adjustment set"
